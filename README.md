# thesis-files
Files used as code samples in my Bachelor's Degree thesis, which is about containers and Kubernetes.

* Directory [_2_](/2) contains files related to *OCI containers*, covered in the second chapter of the thesis.
* Directory [_3_](/3) contains files related to *Kubernetes clusters*, covered in the third chapter of the thesis.

Particularly interesting is the K8S tutorial [in the README for 3/morra](/3/morra).
